INTRODUCTION						*linefeed-introduction*

This plugin provides some "<Plug>" keymappings for Insert Mode to mimic
linefeed(LF) of typewriters. Linefeed of typewriters means that it changes
only the row position and keeps the column position. In order to mimic this
behavior, the keymappings insert <CR> and some whitespaces.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION						*linefeed-installation*

Use your favorite plugin manager, or use |:packadd| if you are using |Vim8| or
later.

==============================================================================
USAGE								*linefeed-usage*

This plugin doesn't have any default configurations. So you need to config to
use it. This is an example configuration:
>
	" NOTE: This configuration overrides some default keymappings.
	imap <C-K> <Plug>(linefeed-goup)
	imap <C-G>k <Plug>(linefeed-up)
	imap <C-G><C-K> <Plug>(linefeed-up)
	imap <C-J> <Plug>(linefeed-godown)
	imap <C-G>j <Plug>(linefeed-down)
	imap <C-G><C-J> <Plug>(linefeed-down)

KEYMAPPINGS						*linefeed-keymappings*

This plugin provides these keymapping:

	inoremap <Plug>(linefeed-up)
	inoremap <Plug>(linefeed-down)
	inoremap <Plug>(linefeed-goup)
	inoremap <Plug>(linefeed-godown)

							*<Plug>(linefeed-up)*
<Plug>(linefeed-up)
	Linefeed to upward direction of the current line.

	For example, you have the following line in the current buffer:

	1	foo |bar

	The vertical bar (|) indicates the cursor position, and it has zero
	width in real. Then you can get the following lines in the current
	buffer if you invoke this keymapping:

	1	    |
	2	foo bar

							*<Plug>(linefeed-down)*
<Plug>(linefeed-down)
	Linefeed to downward direction of the current line.

	For example, you have the following line in the current buffer:

	1	foo |bar

	The vertical bar (|) indicates the cursor position, and it has zero
	width in real. Then you can get the following lines in the current
	buffer if you invoke this keymapping:

	1	foo bar
	2	    |

							*<Plug>(linefeed-goup)*
<Plug>(linefeed-goup)
	Linefeed to upward direction of the current line, but go up with the
	following line of the cursor.

	For example, you have the following line in the current buffer:

	1	foo |bar

	The vertical bar (|) indicates the cursor position, and it has zero
	width in real. Then you can get the following lines in the current
	buffer if you invoke this keymapping:

	1	    |bar
	2	foo 

							*<Plug>(linefeed-godown)*
<Plug>(linefeed-godown)
	Linefeed to upward direction of the current line, but go down with the
	following line of the cursor.

	For example, you have the following line in the current buffer:

	1	foo |bar

	The vertical bar (|) indicates the cursor position, and it has zero
	width in real. Then you can get the following lines in the current
	buffer if you invoke this keymapping:

	1	foo 
	2	    |bar
